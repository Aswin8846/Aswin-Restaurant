    <h1><b>RESEARCH TEAM</b></h1>
    <h2> Identify and understand your customers</h2>
    <p>You may have an idea of what you want or who you think your typical customer is, but that could vary greatly from the folks most likely to dine at your restaurant. To keep your business profitable, clarify your hypothesis, then stress test it using market research. If you have a particular concept in mind, find a market where your type of restaurant will thrive.</p>
    <h2>Get to Know Your Target Market</h2>
    <p>There are informal (cheap) and formal (pricey) methods to assess your concept’s target market. The easiest approach is the in-person visit and dine-in at any competitors in your area. Pay attention to the experience and use your phone to discreetly record your observations for later analysis. And don’t forget to tip well!</p>
    <h2>The Pitfalls of Market Saturation</h2>
    <p>Your pre-opening research should include not only finding out if your concept is a good fit for local customers, but how your concept fits into the existing pool of restaurants in your market.

        In Fields’ example of pivoting from a Mexican to a Southwestern concept, he says his restaurant was the only Southwest-style dining concept in Manhattan’s Theater District, and that this gave it a unique competitive edge.</p>
